# Phase 27 — Variable Subscriptions

## GOAL

Implement the Phase 27 variable-subscription spine without violating the existing Orders-as-truth boundary:
- keep variant + plan coupling explicit through `VariantSubscriptionPlan`
- lock renewal pricing on the subscription contract
- prevent duplicate membership-style purchases while checkout is still pending
- move renewal execution off the single batch worker path with jittered per-subscription jobs

## LINKS CONSULTED

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/phases/phase_26_simple_subscriptions.md`
- `docs/phases/phase_27_variable_subscriptions.md`
- `docs/phases/phase_27a_membership_subscriptions_entitlements.md`
- `docs/phases/phase_28_production_readiness_release_checklist.md`
- `docs/governance/performance_scaling.md`
- `docs/governance/subscriptions_rollout_rollback.md`
- `docs/governance/enforcement_gates.md`

## DECISIONS / PINS

1. `Store.Subscriptions.VariantSubscriptionPlan` is the canonical Phase 27 variant-plan registry; no duplicate `VariantPlan` resource is introduced.
2. Multiple active plans per variant are allowed in Phase 27; the old one-active-plan-per-variant uniqueness index is removed by migration.
3. Subscription renewals charge locked `renewal_amount_minor` + `renewal_currency`, not mutable catalog pricing.
4. Queued plan/variant changes snapshot pending renewal price at request time via pending renewal amount/currency fields.
5. Renewal fan-out uses deterministic jitter derived from binary UUID state, not true random jitter.
6. Membership duplicate blocking uses current domain evidence that exists today:
   - open subscriptions with the same `membership_key`
   - open checkout drafts tied to pending-payment orders for the same user and membership plan
7. Subscription management remains inline on the existing account/admin detail routes; no dedicated manage routes are introduced.
8. Stripe payment-method updates use inline SetupIntent + Elements, not hosted Checkout redirect.
9. Physical renewals are now charge-safe:
   - catalog and variant-plan blockers are retry-suppressed hard failures
   - inventory is reserved before Stripe and explicitly released on known failure paths
   - shipping is re-quoted live, but large quote drift is blocked by a surge circuit breaker

## PLAN

1. Extend the `Subscription` contract and backfill pricing/dunning fields.
2. Add membership duplicate-purchase interlocks in cart add and checkout start.
3. Split the due-renewal worker into a due-tick worker and a per-subscription worker.
4. Add Phase 27 governance notes and update the subscriptions docs-sync gate so it validates Phase 27/27A notes instead of pinning Phase 26 forever.

## DONE

- Added Phase 27 subscription contract fields:
  - `variant_id`
  - `quantity`
  - `renewal_amount_minor`
  - `renewal_currency`
  - `membership_key`
  - `pending_variant_id`
  - `pending_subscription_plan_id`
  - `pending_renewal_amount_minor`
  - `pending_renewal_currency`
  - `change_effective_at`
  - `dunning_attempt_count`
  - `next_retry_at`
- Added migration `20260308090000_phase_27_subscription_contract_pricing_snapshots.exs` with backfill and new indexes/constraints.
- Added migration `20260308173000_phase_27_allow_multiple_active_variant_plans.exs` to drop the stale one-active-plan-per-variant uniqueness constraint.
- Updated subscription creation and renewal paths to populate/reset locked pricing and bounded dunning metadata.
- Added membership duplicate guards in:
  - `Store.Carts.Facade.add_item_for_user/3`
  - `Store.Checkout.start_from_cart/3` through `create_checkout!/3`
- Split renewal execution:
  - `Store.Workers.RunDueSubscriptionRenewalsWorker` now acts as the due tick
  - `Store.Workers.ProcessSubscriptionRenewalWorker` processes one subscription renewal
  - tick fan-out uses deterministic `schedule_in` jitter and unique per-subscription renewal args
- Added Stripe-first virtual checkout renewal spine:
  - mixed-cart initial checkout now requests saved-card-for-off-session semantics when any subscription line exists
  - zero-total subscription checkout switches Stripe payload generation to setup mode
  - renewal processing creates a real renewal order + local payment intent before requesting an off-session charge
  - Stripe off-session payloads include `local_intent_id`, `order_id`, `renewal_attempt_id`, `subscription_id`, and `renewal_key`
- Added webhook race protection:
  - canonical receipts now accept recurring events with no checkout session id
  - webhook payment-intent lookup now falls back to Stripe metadata `local_intent_id`
  - webhook hydration persists Stripe customer/payment-method refs onto the local `payment_intent`
- Added webhook-driven renewal completion:
  - paid renewal orders enqueue `Store.Workers.ReconcilePaidSubscriptionRenewalWorker`
  - renewal reconciliation advances the period once and promotes pending locked pricing/plan/variant snapshots
- Added initial subscription payment-method linkage inside subscription creation:
  - `EnsureSubscriptionsForPaidOrderWorker` now upserts `StoredPaymentMethod` from the successful local `payment_intent`
  - subscriptions are created with stored payment method linkage in the same transaction
- Added SCA/auth-required handling:
  - off-session `requires_action` marks the subscription `:past_due`
  - automatic blind retry is suppressed until grace expiry
  - a `payment_authentication_required` comms outbox path is available with the hosted action URL
- Added boundary-change/account/admin surfaces:
  - storefront product detail now exposes variant plan options and shareable `subscription_plan_key` state
  - account/admin subscription detail pages now support queued plan change, queued variant change, cancel now / cancel at period end, and inline Stripe card update
  - setup-intent webhooks update stored payment methods and immediately retry past-due subscriptions

## NEXT

1. Add broader governance coverage and Phase 27/27A closure gates.
2. Add end-to-end Stripe recurring coverage once a runnable host Mix toolchain is restored in this shell.

## BLOCKERS

- Local `mix` tooling in this shell currently resolves to missing `mise` shims, so compile/test verification for the new Stripe/virtual-checkout slice requires either restored host tooling or a working Elixir container path.

## COMMANDS RUN

- `bd dolt test`
- `bd status`
- `bd ready`
- `bd create ...`
- `bd update ... --claim`
- `bd close ...`
- `mix deps.get`
- `mix compile`
- `mix test test/store/governance/subscriptions_uniqueness_test.exs test/store/subscriptions/facade_test.exs`
- `mix test test/store/workers/subscriptions_run_due_renewals_worker_test.exs test/store/carts/facade_test.exs test/store/checkout/domain_test.exs test/store/subscriptions/facade_test.exs`

## GATES

- Focused subscription compile/tests: PASS
- Membership interlock cart/checkout tests: PASS
- Renewal tick/process worker tests: PASS
- Entitlement cache + membership comms focused tests: PASS

## PERFORMANCE & SCALING REVIEW

- Hot paths:
  - due-subscription selection
  - renewal fan-out enqueue
  - membership duplicate guard in cart/checkout
- Query shape:
  - due-subscription reads remain indexed on `(status, next_renewal_at)` with bounded `limit`
  - past-due retries are keyed off `(status, next_retry_at)`
  - membership duplicate guard checks indexed subscription rows and open checkout draft/order/cart joins
- Herd protection:
  - renewal fan-out schedules one job per subscription with deterministic jitter over a one-hour window
  - per-subscription renewal processing is isolated behind its own worker boundary
- Idempotency:
  - `RenewalAttempt` unique key remains the billing-period anchor
  - per-subscription renewal jobs are unique on worker args (`subscription_id + renewal_key`)
- Remaining risk:
  - physical renewals add one shipping quote call plus one reservation call per processed subscription
  - due-tick scans for past-due subscriptions should use the new partial index on unsuppressed retries
