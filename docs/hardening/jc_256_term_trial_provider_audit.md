# JC-256 term, trial and provider audit

JC-256 is an audit. Production code, commercial rules and deployed provider flags are unchanged. The audit is not PROVEN_GOOD overall. Its three confirmed gaps have separate candidates, and their fixes require their own implementation decisions and PRs.

The branch stacks on JC-248 head `e1f23d179560cffb073b750b08d1a684a2bb87c5`. JC-219 and JC-220 are accepted on canonical main `12cb5ee4107ca465c9b773b258c1cbae4754b2c7`. Historical readiness labels do not change the current repository workflow.

## Executable verdicts

| Feature | Verdict | Evidence and owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `until_canceled`, ordinary paid schedule | `PROVEN_GOOD` for the audited cadence and activation behavior | The configuration has no finite cutoff. Scheduler and paid activation use the ordinary period boundaries. Existing cancellation and dunning tests cover their separate mechanisms; comprehensive certification remains JC-263. |
| `fixed_cycles` | `CANDIDATE` | Limits 1 and 3 allow 2 and 4 verified paid period extensions. JC-362 owns enforcement and true expiry. |
| `fixed_end_at` | `CANDIDATE` | With no prior renewal occurrence, processing at or after the immutable cutoff still dispatches a collection and leaves the Subscription ACTIVE. JC-362 owns the missing guard and terminal source. |
| `trial_days > 0` | `CANDIDATE` | Positive trial values can become effective and sellable, but no executable trial lifecycle was found. JC-363 owns support or explicit gating. |
| Provider-managed billing | `CANDIDATE` | The isolated flag can select a mode without a provider subscription ID; a record in that mode still dispatches merchant collection. JC-364 owns the gate and orchestration decision. |

The repository defaults provider-managed selection to false. With that flag false, Stripe can still select merchant-managed fallback. Yoco's unsupported capabilities reject activation even with the isolated flag true. These negative checks do not certify provider-managed behavior for any provider. Deployed provider configuration and real provider accounts were not inspected.

## Deterministic evidence

The [configuration module](../../test/store/subscriptions/jc256_contract_configuration_audit_test.exs) passed 2 tests. Each test covers six term configurations with trial days 0 and 14. Publication retains the configured immutable fields. Pure initial and next-period calculations stay unchanged when only term and trial fields vary. The fixed reference is June 1, 2026 in UTC.

The [sale and activation module](../../test/store/subscriptions/jc256_sale_activation_audit_test.exs) passed 4 tests. Real cart and checkout finalization accept a 14-day trial with a past fixed end, freeze the exact revision and retain a 1,999-minor-unit line price. Eight paid activation combinations bind that revision, create an ACTIVE Subscription and apply its initial AccessEffect. Separate cases prove Stripe mode selection and unsupported-provider rejection. Test flags restore their exact previous application environment values.

These paid activation fixtures start with a paid Order and succeeded PaymentIntent. They do not prove when a real provider collected an initial customer payment. The activation cases use an empty entitlement pair, so they do not prove trial access.

The [renewal module](../../test/store/subscriptions/jc256_renewal_term_audit_test.exs) passed 3 tests using six committed fixtures and the existing local Stripe double. Fixed-end fixtures use daily cadence and cutoffs one second before, equal to and one second after the June 1 renewal boundary. Every case captures the actual merchant POST and checks its customer, method and exact Subscription, RenewalAttempt, collection and PaymentIntent identities. The cutoff after the boundary is a pre-expiry control; it does not decide a bound occurrence's precedence against a later cutoff.

Cycle limits 1 and 3 complete 2 and 4 paid extensions. Every counted extension requires the actual POST, a verified-success collection, succeeded PaymentIntent, exact success handoff, paid reconciliation and persisted period growth. The proof does not count attempts as cycles or decide whether the initial paid period consumes a cycle. The provider-managed fixture proves merchant dispatch from an already labeled record. Initial flag selection is a separate activation proof.

Fixture construction commits atomically, then registers cleanup before assertions or provider calls. Runtime calls and reads use unboxed Repo connections. Cleanup deletes exact fixture owners, clears the exact user cache key and restores the collection guard within its cleanup transaction. No live provider calls, extra collector processes, database resets or global cache resets are used. The final PR records repository-wide checks and CI for its exact head.

## Immutable contract ownership

[PlanRevision](../../lib/store/subscriptions/plan_revision.ex) owns `term_mode`, `term_cycles`, `term_end_at` and `trial_days` in its immutable commercial field set. New-sale OrderLineItems freeze its ID. Paid activation binds that revision. At renewal checkpoint B, the [facade](../../lib/store/subscriptions/facade.ex) serializes the fields into the immutable charged-contract snapshot.

Modeling and serialization do not execute the fields. [Scheduler](../../lib/store/subscriptions/scheduler.ex) uses cadence, anchor and timezone inputs without a trial or term cutoff. Renewal processing has no term-completion guard. The Subscription resource declares true `mark_expired_transition`, but the source search found no production caller. Retry or grace exhaustion is recoverable suspension, not that missing term producer.

## Lifecycle interactions and unresolved decisions

Fixed terms currently have no enforced final-charge boundary, completed-cycle position, true terminal-expiry producer or corresponding term-end access consequence. The fixed-end proof starts without an in-flight B occurrence and therefore avoids inventing its ordering against a later cutoff. JC-362 must resolve historical term progress, initial-cycle treatment, contract changes, last access, final-cycle failure and dunning, then compose with JC-234's paid-versus-expiry race. Cancellation remains its existing separate instruction; its success does not prove term completion.

Trial start/end, payment-method requirements, initial collection timing, access during trial, cancellation, conversion success/failure, dunning, term consumption and queued changes are `INCONCLUSIVE` without a trial contract. The confirmed defect is admitting commercially meaningful positive trial data without executing or explicitly rejecting it. JC-363 must choose support or gating and define treatment of historical purchased revisions. This audit creates no default free trial or Product policy.

Provider-managed creation/idempotency, provider ID binding, schedule and price ownership, event reconciliation, missing or reordered events, cancellation/rescission, failure states, terms, trials and changes are `INCONCLUSIVE`. The current implementation uses local Scheduler, bound renewal and merchant collection authority. A provider-managed label does not transfer that authority. JC-364 must prevent conflicting collection ownership and define any real supported mode. JC-284 retains the external Paystack validation gate; this audit selects no Paystack mechanism.

Ordinary cancellation, same-renewal recovery, dunning and purchased access policy have dedicated accepted tests, including [cancellation authority](../../test/store/subscriptions/cancellation_renewal_authority_test.exs), [dunning boundaries](../../test/store/subscriptions/sbh_30_05_dunning_adversarial_boundary_test.exs) and [charged-contract reconciliation](../../test/store/subscriptions/sbh_10_05_charged_contract_reconciliation_test.exs). Their coverage does not establish the missing fixed-term or trial-specific interactions. Exhaustive cross-mechanism failure certification remains JC-263.

## Candidate records

- [JC-362](https://linear.app/jc-dev/issue/JC-362/candidate-enforce-immutable-fixed-terms-before-renewal-and-true-expiry) records immutable fixed-term enforcement and true expiry. JC-234 remains the separate expiry-race owner. Promotion-cycle consumption in JC-270 is a separate mechanism.
- [JC-363](https://linear.app/jc-dev/issue/JC-363/candidate-gate-unsupported-positive-trial-contracts-or-define-trial) records positive-trial gating or a defined trial lifecycle.
- [JC-364](https://linear.app/jc-dev/issue/JC-364/candidate-gate-provider-managed-mode-on-implemented-orchestration) records provider-managed gating and orchestration, with JC-284 as the Paystack gate.

The project queue was searched before these candidates were created. They remain Backlog candidates. No production fixes are included in this audit, and none of the findings silently changes another issue's scope.

## Performance & Scaling Review

This PR adds tests and documentation. Production query counts, indexes, caching, queues, uniqueness and telemetry are unchanged. The bounded renewal tests exercise existing hot paths and use exact owned cleanup. They do not measure throughput or capacity.

## Runtime Resource Safety Review

`NOT_APPLICABLE` to production behavior because this PR changes no runtime code. Test cleanup covers committed fixture ownership, the collection trigger and user cache keys. Memory, GC, mailbox, multi-node behavior, post-load convergence and production capacity are `UNMEASURED`; these tests make no resource-safety certification.
